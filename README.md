# pacejka model parameter finder

When creating a vehicle dynamics model is it necessary to take into account the effect of slip ratios on longitudinal forces. A common industry leading model exists called the pajecka model that maps the slip ratios and normal force to the longitudinal forces of a vehicle. However, the model has several parameters that needs to fit to a specific vehicle. 

The code finding optimal parameters of the pacejka model can be found in this [matlab script.](https://github.com/AbdulRahmanSilmy/Pacejka_model_finder/blob/main/pacejka_para_optimizer.m).

## Achieving pacejka model parameters

### Steps

- Normalize the measured data point point values against its corresponding normal force values. This makes calculations easier and is possible because normal force is a multiplication factor in the pacejka model.
- Set up the cost function as the RMSE of the measured longitudinal force against the calculated longitudinal force.
- Because of the complexcity of the pacejka model utilize numerical approximation of a gradient called the symmetric difference quotient. 
- Perform gradient descent based on the numerical approximation of gradient.

## Analysis of Performance

When examining the above graph it is evident that at the slip ratio of zero that majority of measurement points have a positive longitudinal force. Theorotically there shouldn't be any longitudinal force when slip ratio is zero. This leads me to conclude that there might be a systematic error in the measurements that cause the measurements to be too positive specially close to slip ratio of zero. This is a possible explanation to the gradient descent plateau in the graph.
